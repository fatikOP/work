<h1>HTML</h1>
    <i> HTML is an acronym which stands for Hyper Text Markup Language which is used for creating web pages and web
    applications. Let's see what is meant by Hypertext Markup Language, and Web page.

    HYPER TEXT MARKUP LANGUAGE:To represent multiple lines of code, wrap the <code> element within a <pre> element.
         The <code> element by itself only represents a single phrase of code or line of code. A CSS rule can be defined for the code selector
             to override the browser's default font face.

    MARKUP LANGUAGE:The two most common markup languages are HTML, which is used to construct web pages seen across the internet, and XML,
     which stores structured data using customizable tags. When you look at most pages on the internet, you're essentially downloading and
      viewing an HTML page. The page you're reading right now is written in HTML.
      
      WEB PAGE:Although the most uncomplicated layout you will find, it has grown significantly in popularity since the growth of the mobile web.
     That is because the website can use the same design on mobile devices, tablets, and desktops, reducing development time.
       Also, single-column layouts work well for creating a great website.

<h1>PYTHON</h1>
       Python programming is the use of Python, a popular and versatile programming language, to create various applications,
        such as web development, data analysis, machine learning, and more. Python is known for its simple syntax, readability,
         and large collection of libraries that provide many functionalities. Some of the features of Python are123:

It is a high-level, interpreted, and general-purpose language.
It supports multiple programming paradigms, such as object-oriented, procedural, functional, and aspect-oriented.
It has a dynamic type system and automatic memory management.
It has a rich set of built-in data types, such as strings, lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries, and arrays.
It has many standard modules that provide access to system functionality, such as file I/O, database connectivity, web frameworks, GUI toolkits,
 scientific computing, etc.
It can be easily integrated with other languages, such as C, C++, Java, etc.

<h2 id="Javascript"></h2>
<h1>JAVASCRIPT</h1>
JavaScript is a lightweight, cross-platform, single-threaded, and interpreted compiled programming language. It is also known as the scripting 
language for webpages. It is well-known for the development of web pages, and many non-browser environments also use it.

JavaScript is a weakly typed language (dynamically typed). JavaScript can be used for Client-side developments as well as Server-side
 developments. JavaScript is both an imperative and declarative type of language. JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, like Array,
  Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements like operators, control structures, and statements.
  
  Client-side: It supplies objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). Like if client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input,
   and page navigation. Useful libraries for the client side are AngularJS, ReactJS, VueJS, and so many others.
Server-side: It supplies objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For if the server-side extensions allow an application
 to communicate with a database, and provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file
  manipulations on a server. The useful framework which is the most famous these days is node.js.
Imperative language – In this type of language we are mostly concerned about how it is to be done. It simply controls the flow of computation.
 The procedural programming approach, object, oriented approach comes under this as async await we are thinking about what is to be done further after the async call.
Declarative programming – In this type of language we are concerned about how it is to be done, basically here logical computation requires.
 Her main goal is to describe the desired result without direct dictation on how to get it as the arrow function does.</i>
